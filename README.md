# ML Basics: NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib

Welcome to the ML Basics project! This repository provides hands-on, beginner-friendly examples and explanations for three essential Python libraries used in data science and machine learning:

- **NumPy**: Efficient numerical computing and array operations
- **Pandas**: Data analysis and manipulation
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization

Each library is demonstrated with practical code in Jupyter notebooks, and each notebook is accompanied by a detailed markdown explanation in its respective folder.

## 📚 Library Overviews

### NumPy
NumPy (Numerical Python) is the foundational package for numerical computing in Python. It provides:
- Powerful N-dimensional array objects
- Broadcasting and vectorized operations
- Mathematical, logical, and statistical functions
- Tools for integrating with C/C++ and Fortran code

NumPy is the backbone of most scientific and machine learning libraries in Python.

### Pandas
Pandas is a high-level library for data analysis and manipulation. It offers:
- Flexible data structures: Series (1D) and DataFrame (2D)
- Easy data cleaning, filtering, and transformation
- Powerful groupby, aggregation, and merging tools
- Reading/writing data from CSV, Excel, SQL, and more

Pandas is widely used for data wrangling and exploration in data science workflows.

### Matplotlib
Matplotlib is the standard Python library for data visualization. It allows you to:
- Create line, scatter, bar, histogram, box, and many other plots
- Customize plot styles, colors, and layouts
- Visualize trends, distributions, and relationships in data

Matplotlib is highly customizable and integrates well with NumPy and Pandas.
